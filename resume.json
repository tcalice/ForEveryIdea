I reviewed business workflow and simulated data (exchange, structure, and vocabulary) scenarios in tabletop exercises designed to validate enterprise\ncontinuity among ninety-five (95) federal systems. I provided specific program support to J2EE development teams that needed to satisfy Expedited Life Cycle (XLC) quality gates\nwith stringent ADA Accessible (508 compliance) standards for streaming training videos and web interface design. Integrated efforts of multiple development teams and timelines\nfor the timely deployment of new capabilities for a 1.8-billion-dollar initiative that impacts the payments and care delivery of sixty million beneficiaries. I\ndesigned/maintained/validated solution architecture for program stakeholders. The findings of these exercises were used to address impediments and ensure successful solution\ndeployments."},
